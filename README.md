## Introduction
This repo showcases my integrated home network, lab, security, and automation setup. This is meant to document my network for personal use, highlight my technical expertise across various domains, and represent my dedication to continued learning. The various domains covered are:
1. Network Architecture: Designed for high performance and security with segmented VLANs, custom firewall rules, and automated VLAN device assignment
2. Home Lab Architecture: A versatile lab environment featuring a server with Proxmox VE virtualization, extensive NAS storage, and diverse network configurations for technical projects and experimentation
3. Security Cameras & Network Video Recorder (NVR): A security system integrated with multiple IP cameras feeding a centralized NVR over RTSP for comprehensive monitoring and secure access without internet exposure
4. Smart Home Automation: Enhanced convenience through integrated smart devices and platforms for automating tasks and allowing for seamless control.

## Network Architecture
### Diagram

Note. IP addresses omitted.

### Hardware
- Cyberpower uninterruptable power supply (UPS) for power redundancy
- Internet service provider (ISP) provided modem
- Ubiquiti router/switch

### Network Zoning and Segmentation
#### Network Zones
- Trusted Zone: Contains critical and personal devices with the highest security requirements
- Semi-trusted Zone: Contains devices with moderate security requirements. These devices are important, but may have some vulnerabilities or limited security controls.
- Untrusted Zone: Contains devices with the lowest level of trust, primarily guest devices and IoT devices which may contain many vulnerabilities and no security controls.

#### VLANs & Segmentation
In my home network, I've opted for 5 virtual local area networks (VLANs) to support segmentation of devices [(M1030)](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030/) as follows: <br />
Table 1. <br />
*VLANs*
| VLAN  | Network Zone | Devices | Configurations |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| VLAN1: Personal Devices  | Trusted zone  | Personal computers & smartphones | --- |
| VLAN20: Guest Devices  | Untrusted zone  | Guests' laptops, smartphones, & other devices | Guest network: enabled <br />Client device isolation: enabled |
| VLAN30: IoT Devices  | Untrusted zone  | Smart TVs; smart hubs; smart plugs; smart lights; etc. | Isolate network: enabled |
| VLAN40: Cameras  | Semi-trusted zone  | IP cameras; NVR | Isolate network: enabled <br />Allow internet access: disabled (I also have a traffic rule blocking internet access) [(M1035)](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035/) |
| VLAN50: Home Lab  | Semi-trusted zone  | Mini-PC servers; network attached storage (NAS); etc. | --- |

### WiFi
At the time of this push, there are 2 WiFi SSIDs as follows:
- Main network
  - Secured w/ WPA-2 to allow for the use of private pre-shared keys (PPSKs) [(M1041)](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041/)
  - Uses PPSKs to connect devices to their applicable VLAN (not including VLAN20: Guest devices)
- Guest network
  - Allows for guests to connect directly to the Guest VLAN
  - Secured w/ WPA-2/WPA-3 [(M1041)](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041/)
  - For quality-of-life improvements, I've generated a QR code and placed it by my router which allows guests to connect to the guest network without having to know the password

### Password Policy
The password policy for the PPSKs/networks is as follows [(M1027)](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027/)
- Password length minimum: 20
- At least 1 capital letter
- At least 1 lower case letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character

### Identity & Access Management (IAM)
The UniFi management user account must have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled [(M1032)](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/)

## Security Cameras and NVR
### Value Proposition
Enabling my IP cameras to feed into my NVR offers various personal value benefits including but not limited to:
- Improved security: By sending my IP camera feeds to my NVR over my LAN, I'm able to disable internet connectivity for my IP cameras
- Continuous recording: Without an NVR, my IP cameras lose their recordings in the event of an internet outage
- Reduced network load: IP camera feeds would be processed locally, reducing bandwidth load on the network

### Hardware
- 1..3 IP cameras
- Synology NAS/NVR

## Smart Home Automation
### Value Proposition
The main value of my smart home automation and overall IoT setup is an improved quality of life. By automating mundane tasks, my schedule is freed up to engage in more important priorities. This setup also facilitates managing my home while away, monitoring utility usage, and provides a learning opportunity for setting up integrations & automations.

### Hardware
- 1..2 Smart hubs
- 1 Smart doorbell
- 1 Smart robot vacuum
- 1..n Smart lights
- 1..n Matter-enabled smart plugs
- 1..2 Smart TVs

### Setup
At the time of this push, all devices are integrated with Google Home for centralized management. Research/Testing is ongoing to see if a self-hosted instance of Home Assistant meets my requirements.
- The 1..2 smart hubs are matter-enabled hubs for controlling matter-enabled IoT devices

#### Issues
- The smart hubs can't talk with the smart TVs. This is likely due to incompatibility for 1 TV (not running Android) and using a different Google account for the Android TV. More research/testing is required.
